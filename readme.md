Dear Visitor, 

Greetings! This Project was made as a Part of COMP 4990: Project Management of offered by the University of Windsor, and is a recommended course by "ACM".
To see it in action, kindly visit: https://thecompassionapp.myweb.cs.uwindsor.ca/

TheCompassionAPP is Progressive Web Application which can be installed in any PC, Smartphone and Tablet which can run a web browser! It's designed and developed by me using technologies such as HTML, CSS, PHP, JavaScript and MariaDB(MySQL) and using tools such as BootStrap and phpMyAdmin.

The main aim of this application is to make the ends meet- from Patient to Doctor, from an NGO to a person in need, from a Benefactor to a Reciever.

2 gourps of People can register and publish thier information through our Website: Benefactors and Recievers! Banefactors can be NGOs, Registered Mental Health Professionals, Medical Doctors, Nurses, etc. A Reciever can be a Patient, a person,  anyone impacted by COVID-19 in some way and seeking aid/advice from someone!

Once they Register with us, thier information is public, and everyone has access to it through the 'Lists' option!
